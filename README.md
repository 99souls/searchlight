totally not a really mid raycast clone that barely functions <br>
i'm just a silly guy trying to learn some stuff <br>

next steps:

1. commands, vscode command palette type vibes
2. plugins/extensions
3. system utils: file search, calculator, conversions
4. categories/tabs?
5. Organize results by type
6. maybe upgrade search algorithm
